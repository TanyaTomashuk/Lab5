# Lab5
A python game, where the player needs to shoot into two different targets 
(static or moving), using as few cannon balls of two types as he can
(Press Space button to shoot with the square cannon, and the right mouse
button to shoot with the circle cannon). 
The power and the direction of the gun depend only on the player's 
wish and skills of playing this amazing game. 
The score and the number of used balls can be seen on the screen 
while playing. The levels and the difficulty (depending on the current 
score) are updating automatically.
